# SilentShutdown
You may have heard that you can shutdown any computer if you input the command "shutdown -i" into CMD. You've maybe even tried it, but it didn't work, so I've created this program which lets you do exactly that (and more...). You'll have to install Python's latest version if you want this to work. Here is the link: https://www.python.org/downloads/. DOwnload Python's latest version, and you can use my program.
